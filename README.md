<h4 align="center">What i'm learning now?</h4>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js, a tool I use for developing dynamic web applications with React. I recently applied these skills in a group project, and you can find the repository for this project here https://github.com/SebaGatti91/PF-GreenWave-Front. I'm also keen on expanding my skills with Vue.js and React Native to tackle user interface projects and cross-platform mobile applications.**
